Create a VPC

Create two subnet groups: public and private

Create one EC2 instance in the public subnet and one EC2 instance in the private subnet

Ensure that the EC2 instance in the public subnet is accessible over the internet, allowing you to connect via SSH

Ensure that the EC2 instance in the private subnet is not accessible from the internet but is accessible from the EC2 instance in the public subnet

Ensure that the EC2 instance in the private subnet has access to the internet
